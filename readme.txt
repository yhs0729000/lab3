observe the result of this program , it isn't hard to find out 
that the time coparing v1 and v2 grew when size value became 
bigger than before . when size is ten times of previous one ,
the seconds that program spend are a hundred times of before.
So even i don't get the last one ,i predict that to be 8000s.
